Overall
================
Design mobile first, or more precisely all 3 at the same time, really important.
Everything is fixed budget, be prepared to compromise.
Nothing can ever be pixel perfect on all devices everywhere.


Images
================
- Limit the different sizes of CMS driven images, otherwise it means lots more effort from client or backend developer, usually both.
- Please try to design with same image ratio on mobile and desktop, no swapping images on the fly.


Copy
=================
- Try to limit types of fonts used, confuses uses as to hierarchy of content
- Avoid headers and links sharing colours, unless that header is a link
- The more the variety of fonts, the longer the download time and bandwidth usage
- Headers with 2 colors will be difficult in CMS


Layout
================
- If you can, avoid layout with fixed height copy, this will not work when in CMS
- Always use webFonts to design your icons, not images as they look terrible on high res screens http://glyphicons.bootstrapcheatsheets.com and http://fontawesome.io/cheatsheet
- Try to measure accurately, HTML is all maths, we divide by 3 or 4 etc, 1 pixel out in PSD can become 4 in HTML
- Use the same size and dimensions for elements from page to page, e.g form fields, easier to code and easier to understand by user
- Avoid using same design for different meaning, e.g radio button and checkbox should look different
- Consistency, no green input text on one page and black on another
- Less 'click here/more' links, back for SEO and accessibility


PSD
================
- Clear labeling of on/off states, due to development being done remotely
